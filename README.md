# LaunchPad
Launch-Pad is a crowdfunding web application where people sign up and post campaigns they want funding for. 
Integrated various features like user following/followers, likes, newsfeed that collectively shows details of the users you follow 
and the campaigns you like, search feed, add pledges, rate campaigns, edit details and more. 
Developed an innovative front end to improve the look and feel of the application. 

Wrote triggers that automatically charged the sponsors that backed the campaigns if the campaign is funded. Additionally, wrote events
that helped in auto-changing the status of the campaigns (Funding, Funded, Failed, Completed) if any campaign surpass their end date. 

Added more user oriented functionalities like adding a update, rate campaigns, edit profile, add payment cards. 
Users can pledge only if the campaign status is 'Funding'. Used cards to display campaignns and users to improve the feel of the 
web application.

Integrated the search feed with search pills that displayed results in their respective pills. 

The news feed mentioned gives a collective information of all the activities by the people the user follows (likes, comments, pledges) 
and also the updates on the campaigns the user has liked.
