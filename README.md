# LaunchPad
Launch-Pad is a crowdfunding web application where people can sign up and post campaigns they want funding for or support campaigns they want to by providing funds. 
Integrated various features like user following/followers, likes, newsfeed that collectively shows details of the users you follow and the campaigns you like, search feed, funding a campaign, rate campaigns, edit details and more. 

Wrote triggers that automatically charged the sponsors that backed the campaigns if the campaign is funded. Additionally, wrote events that helped in auto-changing the status of the campaigns (Funding, Funded, Failed, Completed) if any campaign surpass their end date. 

Added more user oriented functionalities like adding an update, rate campaigns, edit profile, add payment cards. 
Users can pledge only if the campaign status is 'Funding'. Used cards to display campaignns and users to improve the feel of the web application. Integrated the search feed with search pills that displayed results that match the keyword in their respective fields. 

The news feed mentioned gives a collective information of all the activities by the people the user follows (likes, comments, pledges) and also provides updates on the campaigns the user has liked.

Developed an attractive and innovative front-end to improve the look and feel of the application.
